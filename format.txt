// ! Consider extending all bytecodes to the same length (7 (8?) bytes)
// ! 8 bytes required for the discering of which client is requesting the current file
// Actions always come first (first byte) as this determines what the rest of the bytecode means. Hence,
// for all bytecodes less than 8 bytecodes long, all subsequent bits will be set to 0 or otherwise ignored.
// Said bytecodes are depicted as 0xYY...00
